Changes in version 0.10.1 (2017-04-20)

BUGFIXES:
* Fix a problem that made fail build on mac osx.


Changes in version 0.10 (2017-04-05)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* Function margins() has been replaced by addUpwardMargin() and addDownwardMargin(). they are easier to use, add directly the new columns to the input data and are far more efficient.

NEW FEATURES:
* The package now adds new aliases to use in the parameter 'select' of antaresRead::readAntares. Each function has its own alias, so it is now easier for the user to read all data required by a given function. Use 'showAliases()' to see the list of aliases.

BUGFIXES:
* Function synthesize() set incorrect values for attributes of antaresDataList objects.


Changes in version 0.9 (2017-01-25)

NEW FEATURES:
* function addLoadFactorLink() now adds two columns: "loadFactor" and "congestion".

BUG FIXES:
* Minor bugfixes due to evolution of "antaresRead"

Changes in version 0.8 (2016-11-14)

BUGFIXES:
* Compatibility with version 0.14 of antaresRead.
* The definition of downward margins was inexact and has been corrected.

NEW FEATURES:
* New function addLoadFactorLink() to compute the load factor of links.


Changes in version 0.7 (2016-10-06)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* add a file LICENSE and copyright to sources files


Changes in version 0.6 (2016-08-22)

NEW FEATURES:
* New function addExportAndImport() adds import, export and link capacity to areas and districts.


Changes in version 0.5 (2016-08-01)

NEW FEATURES:
* New function 'synthesize' that synthesizes different Monte-Carlo scenarios. It computes the average of every variable but can also compute custom statistics like minimum, maximum, median, quantiles, etc.


Changes in version 0.4 (2016-07-18)

NEW FEATURES:
* Function 'surplusClusters' now returns fixed and variable costs of production.
* Function "surplusSectors" now returns columns "sector", "surplus" and "cost" instead of one column per sector.
* ROW balance is now included in the computation of the surplus of an area. A new column "rowBalanceSurplus is non available."
*New function "loadFactor". It returns the load factor of a cluster and the time at Pmin and at Pmax.


Changes in version 0.3 (2016-07-04)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* Function addRamps is replaced by netLoadRamp. It returns a table with the ramps of net load and balance and aggregates them at desired time step or among Monte-Carlo scenarios.

NEW FEATURES:
* Function "modulation" can now return modulation of sectors per area and per district.
* New function "margins" to compute upward and downward margins of an area.
* surplusClusters now returns production costs and start-up costs.

BUGFIXES:
* Computation of ramps, modulations and costs of last unit was erronous because of bad sorting of data



Changes in version 0.2 (2016-06-20)

NEW FEATURES:
* New function 'compare' to compares the surpluses of two simulations.
* 'surplus' and 'surplusSectors' can now aggregate results by district.
* 'surplus', 'surplusSectors' and 'surplusClusters' can now compute the average surplus off the Monte-Carlo scnearios.
* New functions addNetLoad and addRamps that add new columns to an antaresData object.
* 'surplusClusters' returns a new column "economicGradient".
* 'surplusClusters' gains a new argument 'surplusLastUnit' to indicate if the function should compute the surplus of last unit or not.
* Function 'surplus' now distinguishes the production of virtual nodes.

BUGFIXES:
* When computing the surplus of the last unit of a cluster, 'surplusCLusters' now uses the number of available units instead of the total number of units.
