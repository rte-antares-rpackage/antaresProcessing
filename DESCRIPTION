Description: 
    Process results generated by 'Antares', a powerful open source software developed by
    RTE (Réseau de Transport d’Électricité) to simulate and study electric power systems (more information about
    'Antares' here: <https://github.com/AntaresSimulatorTeam/Antares_Simulator>).
    This package provides functions to create new columns like net load, load factors, upward and
    downward margins or to compute aggregated statistics like economic surpluses
    of consumers, producers and sectors.
