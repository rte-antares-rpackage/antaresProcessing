Description:
    Process results generated by Antares, a powerful software developed by RTE 
    and used to simulate and study electric power systems 
    <https://antares.rte-france.com>. This package provides functions to create
    new columns like net load, load factors, upward and downward margins or to 
    compute aggregated statistics like economic surpluses of consumers, producers
    and sectors. It requires package "antaresRead" 
    (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=antaresRead>) to read the results of 
    an Antares simulation.
